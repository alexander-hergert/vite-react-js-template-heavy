# Template for React Vite setup with JavaScript

This is the setup I use for bigger React projects in JavaScript.
The projects have multiple pages and have a lot of functionality and complex state manipulation across the project.
For fetching data RTK Query is used or async thunks.

## This template uses following setups

- Please remove the .git file by using command "rm -rf .git"
- Then use "git init" again
- Then "npm install" or "yarn install"
- Then "npm update" or "yarn upgrade"

### Using React Router for routing

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) React Router is a popular library for routing in React applications. It allows you to navigate between different pages or views in your single-page application (SPA).

I hope this might inspire you to create your own template which you can keep on modifying and ofcourse create different variants.

Happy coding!
